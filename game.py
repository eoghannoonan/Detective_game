# Date: November 25th, 2023.
# Game Expansion Explanation:
# In this expansion of our mystery game, "SHadow Chronicles," The Elite Coders group
# introduces an exciting new expansion to the game. We have added three different
# locations at which you can solve the mysteries.
#
#
# File Strcuture:
# - main_game.py: The main game script
#
#
#
# Running the Game:
# - To play "The Detective's Enigma" with our exciting expansions, run the
#  "main_game.py" file.
#
#
# Enjoy the game and have fun becoming the ultimate detective!
